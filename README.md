# Agent Based Model for Honeybee Foraging Behaviour

## Introduction
This Project contains classes for simulating foraging behaviour of honey bees, and for collecting data in arbitrary time intervals. The simulation outpus the net energy of the bee hive at the end

## Installation
The package requires mesa >= 3.x.x to run.
